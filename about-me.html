            My name's Kenze, a 16 year old graphic designer based in Singapore. You might have heard of my through my other alias, <i>emperor_wee</i> or <i>Monarch Doge</i>.

            I first entered the world of graphic design when i was 16, doing simple photoshop manipulation project after classes. Since then, I have extended my skills from Photoshop art pieces to Isometric art to Pixel art.  Recently I have started doing short pixel art GIFs which have started to gain attention on many art sites like Graphic Design Central and Pixel Output. Iâ€™m currently studying for a diploma in Information technology at Singapore polytechtnic to hopefully land a job as a game designer and developer.

            I speciallize mostly in pixel art drawings and gifs as well as Photoshop manipulation art. Need someone to design an advertisement, make an album cover or just want some fancy custom art for yourself &#63; Then I'm your man.
